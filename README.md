# Insight Data Science Project

As an Insight Data Science Fellow I undertook a consultancy project. 
Working with a start-up, our goal was to increase the efficiency of electric vehicles. 
My project goal was to use machine learning to predict the power requirement of a vehicle at some point in the future. 
I showcased some of my work as a web app. 

You can find the web app here: http://jkattirtzi.tk/

In this repository I include 2 example files that show the types of algorithms that I used. 

Clean_data.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook shows how I detect anomalies by using the time derivative and I remove extreme values


VAR.ipynb - This Jupyter Notebook implements Time Series predictions using Variable Autoreggresive algorithms. It is a very simplified version. 
As such the accuracy shown here is much lower than that of the final code. 

The final code was handed over to the company to be implemented in their controls software.
